    "\n",
    "    1. How many get infected by the virus but has no (serious) symptoms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The dark numbers is a big issue. It's good if they are large. Then the true mortality rate is lower, and we would reach herd immunity sooner, which again would lower the infection rate (R). It's still a challenge that we do not know the dark numbers, and they will vary a lot from country to country depending on how many people are tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Would you be immune if you had it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Most likely. Repeat cases have not been documented. However, it is too soon to tell if immunity could be lost over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Viruses are known to mutate. Will COVID-19 get stronger or milder over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The virus is mutating, but very slowly, and the copies are not far from the original virus. This type of virus (RNA) is more likely to mutate into a weaker version. Overall that's a good thing. However, when such viruses get weaker, they tend to transfer more easily, which again would increase the infection rate (R). Source: \n",

There are also countries not all of the population are registered as citizens; they are outside the system.
